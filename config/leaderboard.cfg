# Global leaderboard backend settings.
#
# Set leaderboard.enabled=true and provide an HTTP endpoint that supports:
# - GET  <endpoint>?limit=N  -> JSON array or { entries: [] }
# - POST <endpoint>          -> accepts JSON score payload
#
# endpointUrl can be:
# - auto                       (resolves to http(s)://<current-host>:8787/leaderboard)
# - explicit URL               (for deployed/shared backends)
#
# SECURITY NOTE:
# - The 'auto' endpointUrl is intended for local development only.
# - For production deployments, configure leaderboard.endpointUrl to point to a
#   properly secured leaderboard service.
# - The production leaderboard backend SHOULD implement authentication and
#   authorization for write operations (submitting scores) and SHOULD apply
#   appropriate rate limiting and input validation to prevent abuse.
